## Abstract

Powell is a decentralized healthcare financial infrastructure designed to help individuals coordinate, protect, and manage healthcare-related funds in a transparent and capital-efficient way.

Instead of paying non-refundable premiums to centralized insurers, users commit personal healthcare capital to time-bound healthcare protection plans represented as NFTs. These NFTs define participation terms, duration, and eligible reimbursement categories. User funds are pooled transparently on-chain and remain attributable to participants throughout the lifecycle of each plan.

Healthcare expenses are handled through a reimbursement-first model. Medical review, validation, and approval are performed off-chain by licensed Third-Party Administrators (TPAs) and healthcare professionals. Once approved, reimbursements are settled on-chain via smart contracts, ensuring auditable and predictable fund flows. At the end of each plan period, any unused funds are automatically returned to the participant.

Powell decentralizes custody, accounting, and settlement of healthcare-related funds while keeping medical decisions and clinical responsibility fully off-chain. By applying collective self-insurance and cost-sharing principles, reducing administrative inefficiencies, and enabling transparent financial coordination at scale, Powell aims to lower the effective cost of healthcare and expand access to reliable healthcare protection globally.

Powell does not provide medical services, make medical decisions, or act as a healthcare provider. It operates as financial infrastructure that complements existing healthcare systems.

## Introduction

Across the world, healthcare costs continue to rise faster than general inflation. Hospital care, medication, diagnostics, and specialist treatments grow more expensive each year, placing increasing pressure on individuals, families, employers, and public healthcare systems. Even those with traditional insurance face rising premiums, higher deductibles, and reduced coverage certainty.

At the same time, conventional healthcare financing models are structurally inefficient. Individuals are required to make recurring payments regardless of actual healthcare usage. When no medical expenses occur, these payments are typically lost, while healthcare costs continue to rise in the background. Over time, this model erodes personal savings and reduces long-term access to care.

Powell (People Wellness) was created in response to these challenges.

Powell is built on the principle that individuals should retain ownership and visibility over the capital they commit for healthcare protection. Staying healthy should not result in permanent loss of capital, and preparing for medical risk should not require reliance on opaque financial intermediaries with misaligned incentives.

By applying self-insurance and collective cost-sharing concepts—traditionally available only to large organizations—Powell enables individuals to coordinate healthcare risk transparently and efficiently. Blockchain technology is used to manage fund custody, accounting, and settlement, ensuring that committed funds are visible, auditable, and governed by deterministic rules.

Powell is designed to complement, not replace, existing healthcare systems. Medical diagnosis, treatment, and clinical decision-making remain the responsibility of licensed professionals operating off-chain. Powell focuses exclusively on financial coordination and settlement.

The platform is built with future interoperability in mind, supporting modern healthcare data standards such as **HL7 FHIR**, enabling more efficient reimbursement workflows and system integration over time.

By reducing administrative overhead, aligning incentives around wellness, and preventing unnecessary capital loss, Powell aims to lower the effective cost of healthcare while increasing transparency and trust.

## Problem Statement

### Rising Medical Costs and Medical Inflation

Healthcare costs continue to rise due to:

- Aging populations  
- Increasing use of advanced medical technologies  
- Administrative inefficiencies  
- Fragmented healthcare financing systems  

---

### Inefficiency of Traditional Premium-Based Models

Conventional healthcare financing often relies on sunk-cost payments:

- Contributions are typically non-refundable  
- Healthy individuals receive limited financial benefit  
- Incentives favor cost containment over user outcomes  

This structure penalizes individuals for remaining healthy and discourages proactive wellness.

---

### Limited Access to Self-Insurance and Cost Sharing

Self-insurance and collective cost-sharing models offer capital efficiency and control but are generally available only to:

- Corporations  
- Governments  
- Large institutions  

Individuals lack access to transparent, collective tools for managing healthcare financial risk.

## What Is Powell?

Powell is a decentralized healthcare financial coordination system.

Participants commit funds to time-bound healthcare protection plans. These funds are pooled transparently through smart contracts and used to reimburse eligible healthcare expenses following off-chain validation. Any unused funds are returned to participants at the end of each plan period.

Powell does not provide medical care, make medical determinations, or replace healthcare providers. It coordinates healthcare-related financial flows in a transparent and rules-based manner.

## System Architecture

### On-Chain Components

- Participation NFTs defining plan terms and duration  
- Treasury smart contracts  
- Reimbursement and refund settlement logic  
- Governance and parameter management contracts  

### Off-Chain Components

- Licensed healthcare providers  
- Third-Party Administrators (TPAs)  
- Medical review and validation systems  

### Medical Records

Medical records are not stored on-chain. Cryptographic references or hashes may be anchored on-chain to ensure:

- Data integrity  
- Verifiability  
- Future portability  

The system supports interoperability with healthcare data standards such as **HL7 FHIR**.

---

## Participation Plans & Benefit Parameters

Participation plans include:

- Plan duration (typically 1 year)  
- Maximum reimbursement limits  
- Eligible expense categories  
- Settlement and refund rules  

Committed funds represent healthcare capital allocation rather than guaranteed payouts.

If approved healthcare expenses exceed a participant’s remaining balance, additional reimbursements may be sourced from shared protocol reserves, subject to predefined limits and governance-approved parameters.

## Numeric Examples

### Example Plan

- Committed amount: **1,000 USDT**  
- Administrative fee (5%): **50 USDT**  
- Net pooled balance: **950 USDT**

### Scenario A — No Healthcare Expenses
- Returned to participant: **950 USDT**

### Scenario B — Partial Expenses
- Returned to participant: **650 USDT**

### Scenario C — Full Utilization
- Returned to participant: **0 USDT**

### Scenario D — High-Cost Medical Event
- Covered from participant balance: **950 USDT**  
- Covered from shared reserves: **350 USDT**

---

## Fund Management & Treasury

All participant funds:

- Are visible on-chain  
- Are segregated from operational entities  
- Are governed by deterministic smart contracts  
- Are managed conservatively  

Treasury buffers are maintained to manage expense variability and operational risk.

---

## Revenue Model & Allocation

Annual allocation:

- **60%** — Shared reserves and system stability  
- **20%** — Foundation and ecosystem development  
- **20%** — Participant rewards or governance token burn  

---

## HP Token Model

- **Token:** HP  
- **Max Supply:** 100,000,000  

### Utility

- Governance participation  
- Incentive alignment  
- Rewards distribution  

HP is optional and not required to use Powell.

---

## Governance

Governance manages:

- Protocol parameters  
- Treasury strategy  
- System upgrades  

Governance does **not** control medical decisions or treatments.

---

## Compliance & Risk Disclosure

Powell:

- Is not a healthcare provider  
- Is not a medical authority  
- Does not provide medical advice  
- Does not store raw medical data on-chain  

### Key Risks

- Healthcare expense concentration  
- Treasury volatility  
- Regulatory changes  

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Reimbursement Coordination Pilot  
### Phase 2 — Governance Activation  
### Phase 3 — Ecosystem Integration  
### Phase 4 — Cashless Settlement Enablement  
### Phase 5 — Community & Infrastructure Support  
### Phase 6 — Global Expansion  

---

## Vision

Powell exists to give people ownership and transparency over their healthcare financial protection.

---

## Conclusion

Powell is not an insurance company.  
It is **decentralized healthcare financial infrastructure**—built for people to own, coordinate, and protect their wellness capital.
