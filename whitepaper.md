## Abstract

Powell is a decentralized health insurance platform built to give people ownership over their own wellness and to make healthcare more accessible, affordable, and efficient over time.

Instead of paying non-refundable premiums, users purchase health insurance policies represented as NFTs, which define coverage terms and duration. Policy funds are pooled transparently on-chain, while medical records are anchored on-chain in a privacy-preserving format to ensure integrity, portability, and future interoperability.

In its initial stage, claims are reimbursement-based and managed off-chain by licensed Third-Party Administrators (TPAs). Once approved, claims are settled on-chain through smart contracts, providing transparent and auditable payouts. At the end of each policy period, any unused policy funds are automatically returned to the policyholder.

Powell decentralizes fund custody, accounting, and settlement while keeping medical decisions off-chain for compliance and practicality. By applying self-insurance principles, reducing administrative inefficiencies, and enabling transparent coordination at scale, Powell aims to lower global healthcare costs and build a system where high-quality healthcare is accessible to everyone—not just those who can afford expensive insurance.

## Introduction

Across the world, medical costs continue to rise faster than general inflation. Each year, the price of hospital care, medication, diagnostics, and specialist treatment increases, placing growing pressure on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Even people with insurance are increasingly exposed to higher premiums, higher deductibles, and reduced coverage.

At the same time, traditional health insurance is fundamentally inefficient. People are required to pay recurring premiums regardless of whether they use healthcare services. For healthy individuals, this often results in years of payments with no financial return, while the real cost of healthcare continues to inflate in the background. Over time, this model erodes personal savings and reduces access to care.

Powell (People Wellness) was created in response to these realities.

Powell is built on the belief that individuals should own their health protection, especially in a world where medical costs rise year after year. Staying healthy should not mean losing money, and protecting oneself against medical risk should not require surrendering capital to opaque systems with high administrative overhead.

By applying self-insurance principles—traditionally used by large corporations—Powell enables individuals to collectively pool health risk in a transparent and efficient way. Blockchain technology is used to manage fund custody, accounting, and settlement, ensuring that policy funds are visible, auditable, and fairly handled throughout the policy lifecycle.

Powell is designed to complement existing healthcare systems, not replace them. Medical decisions, diagnoses, and treatments remain off-chain and are handled by licensed professionals, while financial coordination is enforced by smart contracts.

The platform is also built with future interoperability in mind, supporting modern healthcare data standards such as **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, enabling more efficient claims processing and integration over time.

By reducing administrative inefficiencies, aligning incentives around wellness, and preventing unnecessary loss of capital, Powell aims to lower the effective cost of healthcare over time.

## Problem Statement

### Rising Medical Costs and Medical Inflation

Healthcare costs continue to increase year after year due to:

- Aging populations  
- Expensive medical technology  
- Administrative inefficiencies  
- Fragmented healthcare systems  

This medical inflation places growing pressure on individuals, employers, and governments.

### Inefficiency of Premium-Based Insurance

Traditional insurance operates on sunk-cost premiums:

- Payments are non-refundable  
- Healthy users subsidize the system  
- Insurers benefit most when claims are low  

This creates a system where being healthy is financially punished.

### Limited Access to Self-Insurance

Self-insurance allows capital preservation and control, but today it is available only to:

- Corporations  
- Governments  
- Large institutions  

Individuals lack access to transparent, collective self-insurance tools.

## What Is Powell?

Powell is a decentralized health insurance pool.

Users purchase 1-year health insurance policies, and their funds are pooled transparently through smart contracts. Claims reduce the pool, and any unused funds are returned at the end of the policy period.

Powell does not replace healthcare providers. It coordinates financial protection, not medical decisions.

## System Architecture

### On-Chain Components

- Policy NFTs (coverage terms, duration)  
- Treasury smart contracts  
- Settlement and refund logic  
- Governance contracts  

### Off-Chain Components

- Healthcare providers  
- Third-Party Administrators (TPAs)  
- Claims verification systems  

### Medical Records

Medical records are anchored on-chain in a privacy-preserving format (hashes or references), ensuring:

- Data integrity  
- Auditability  
- Future portability  

The system is designed to support interoperability with healthcare data standards such as **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}** for future integrations.

## Policy Plans & Benefit Limits

Powell policies are issued with defined plans and benefit limits. Each policy specifies:

- Coverage duration (1 year)  
- Maximum benefit limit  
- Eligible claim categories  
- Settlement rules  

The policy price represents the user’s committed capital, but coverage is not strictly limited to the policy price alone.

If a policyholder’s approved medical claims exceed their remaining policy balance, Powell will cover the excess amount from the protocol treasury, subject to predefined limits and governance-approved parameters.

This design ensures:

- Predictable protection for users  
- Risk pooling across the community  
- Stronger confidence during high-cost medical events  

Coverage beyond the policy balance is governed by:

- Policy plan limits  
- Treasury solvency rules  
- Risk parameters set through governance

## Numeric Examples

### Example Policy

- Policy price: **1,000 USDT**  
- Admin fee (5%): **50 USDT**  
- Net coverage pool: **950 USDT**

### Scenario A — No Claims

- Claims used: 0  
- Returned to user: **950 USDT**

### Scenario B — Partial Claims

- Claims used: 300 USDT  
- Returned to user: **650 USDT**

### Scenario C — Full Usage

- Claims used: 950 USDT  
- Returned to user: **0 USDT**

### Scenario D — High Medical Cost Event

- Approved claims: **1,300 USDT**  
- Covered from policy balance: **950 USDT**  
- Covered from treasury: **350 USDT**  
- Returned to user: **0 USDT**

---

## Fund Management & Treasury

All policy funds:

- Are visible on-chain  
- Are segregated from company assets  
- Are managed conservatively  
- Aim to preserve value against inflation  

Treasury buffers are maintained to manage claim variability and market risk.

## Revenue Model & Profit Distribution

Platform profit is distributed annually as follows:

- **60%** — Treasury (stability & solvency)  
- **20%** — Foundation (development & ecosystem growth)  
- **20%** — Rewards for active policyholders or governance token burn  

This aligns incentives across users, contributors, and long-term sustainability.

## HP Token Model

- **Token name:** HP  
- **Maximum supply:** 100,000,000  

### Utility

- Governance participation  
- Platform value capture  
- Rewards distribution  

HP is not required to use Powell but strengthens long-term alignment.

---

## Governance

Powell governance manages:

- Protocol parameters  
- Treasury strategy  
- Platform upgrades  

Governance does **not** control:

- Medical decisions  
- Diagnosis or treatment  

---

## Compliance & Risk Disclosure

Powell:

- Is not a healthcare provider  
- Is not a medical authority  
- Does not store raw medical data on-chain  

### Key Risks

- Claim concentration  
- Market volatility  
- Regulatory changes  

These risks are mitigated through transparency, conservative management, and fixed policy periods.
